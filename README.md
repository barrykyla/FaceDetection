# FaceDetection
So I decided to do my face detection project off of masks. I chose this idea because the anonimity behind masks are not seen 
very much today. We all are so public with everything that we do, so as an ode to that I created a mask no one can hide behind.
My masks background is the webcam becasue it is something that Not many can hide behind. Similarly, it is something we all try to
posses. I hoped this project put in persepctive the actual "privacy" we have, and created this project as a metaphore for our lives 
today.

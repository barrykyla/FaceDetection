# FaceDetection
So I decided to do my face detection project off of masks. I chose this idea because the anonimity behind masks are not seen 
very much today. We all are so public with everything that we do, so as an ode to that I created a mask no one can hide behind.
My masks background is the webcam becasue it is something that Not many can hide behind. Similarly, it is something we all try to
posses. I hoped this project put in persepctive the actual "privacy" we have, and created this project as a metaphore for our lives 
today.

My original inspiration was based off of a mask from the small country of Burkino Faso, and was used in religious ceremonies. 
I felt as though I could go deeper so had done research on other masks of the area. I also chose the colors based off of the Bejing Opera masks. I did this in order to include some of my own culture as well.
